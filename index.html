      <p class="location">Yad Vashem</p>

      <p class="desc">
        Tourists flock to the Old City of Jerusalem to witness and experience
        the most sacred Christian sites in the world; Among a number of sites,
        there's the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Wailing Wall, and the
        Holocaust Remembrance Museum (Yad Vashem). Pilgrims visit the Church of
        the Holy Sepulchre that was built over the sight of the crucifixion and
        houses the Tomb of Jesus. No pilgrimage to Jerusalem is complete without
        a visit to the Wailing Wall. Jews often wail as they offer prayers to
        the wall, which is a stark reminder to the Jewish people of the
        destruction of two of their temples during Roman rule. A must-see for
        tourists is the Yad Vashem, where one can view monuments, artifacts,
        memorial sites, and personal accounts of holocaust survivors.

      <img src="images/S.avif" alt="Sochi, Russia" />
      <p class="location">Krasnaya Polyana</p>
      <p class="desc">
        Sochi is a sight to behold. Although it is not as famous as Russia's
        capital city of Moscow, it boasts of many mountain sceneries, beaches,
        rivers, and alps during wintertime. Krasnaya Polyana, in particular,
        homes plenty of tourist spots in the city. It has enough hotels that can
        accomodate thousands of tourists and serves as a dream vacation
        destination to many. Sochi has also hosted sporting events like the F1
        grand prix and the winter olympics.

    <section id="NewYork">
      <h2>NEW YORK, U.S.A.</h2>
      <img src="images/NY.avif" alt="New York, U.S.A." />
      <p class="location">9/11 Memorial and Museum</p>
      <p class="desc">
        New York is famous for its skyscrapers but visitors will find themselves
        looking down to marvel at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Built on what
        used to be the World Trade Center complex, this mostly underground
        installation has become a staple in New York must-visit lists especially
        for first timers. The memorial to the deadliest terror attack on the US
        was opened to the public on September 11, 2011, a decade after the
        tragic event.
